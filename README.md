# Work-in-progress to migrate to Argon2 in Bitwarden

This repository is a fork of Bitwarden/jslib as of 2020-03-21 for the purpose of moving to Argon2 in Bitwarden, and hopefully creating PR for the upstream to move to. The goal is not to be a long-term alternative to Bitwarden, but rather to do the work necessary to allow for a move to a more modern algorithm.
